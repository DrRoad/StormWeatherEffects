## Date: October 2014 ##

This Project consists of the source file for the second peer assessed project in the Reproducible Research Unit of the Data Science Specialisation undertaken by Johns Hospkins University on the Coursera website.

It processes a database from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on storm data across the United States in 1997. The analysis will answer 2 basic questions, namely...

1. Across the United States, which types on events are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the Unites States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequenses?

The final report for this analysis can be found at the RPubs website: [http://rpubs.com/apittendreigh/35374](http://rpubs.com/apittendreigh/35374)
