# Synopsis #

In this report I aim to explore the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA) storm database from 17 August 2007 to answer questions as to which types of events across the United States are the most harmful with respect to the health of the population and which types of events have the greatest economic consequences. 

To undertake this exploration data was obtained from NOAA's National Weather Service.
